# Number Guessing Game (Python Project)

## Project Information
- Student Name: Amsal Fatima  
- Program: BSCS (2nd Semester)  
- Submitted to: Adnan Sir  


## Introduction
This is a simple Python project.  
The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 50.  
The user guesses the number.  
The program gives hints if the guess is too high or too low.  
It also shows the number of attempts when the correct answer is found.  

## Concepts Used
- Random number generation  
- Loops  
- If-else conditions  
- Variables  


## How to Run
1. Install Python on your computer.  
2. Save the file number_guessing_game.py.  
3. Run it using the command:
